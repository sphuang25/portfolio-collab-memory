# Project Phase 2: Divergent Design


## Broad Application Goals

Our group is introducing the app **fam.ly**, an app that creates a shared memory space for family members to contribute to over time, especially designed for those who want to learn/converse more with thier family but struggle due to distance, time, or a lack of knowing where to start. **fam.ly** provides personalized and structured prompts to guide insightful conversations, with additional “deeper” questions developed by AI as conversations grow deeper. Families are able to annotate and share photos, letting users gradually discover stories from their relatives and create a sense of connection even across distance. Then, memories are stored in an archive for easy access, where memories can be re-opened for families to go back to again. **fam.ly** differs from other apps in both its personalized and structured prompts, AI integration, and memory-specific archiving. 


##  Scrapbook of Comparables
### Slack
<img src="./images_p2/image (93).png" alt="alt text" width="500" height="300">

- Different channels (organized on the side) that all have different categories of what the chat is about	
- Our app would have different “channels” with chats that will focus on certain memories or moments

<img src="./images_p2/image (94).png" alt="alt text" width="500" height="300">

#### Archiving system
Divides into all channels -> can sort to investigate different channel types (public– open to anyone, private – limited in members, archived - once archived chats that aren’t located in your “home” for easier accessibility)

### myfamilyarchive.com
<img src="./images_p2/image (95).png" alt="alt text" width="400" height="200">

- Uploading profiles for each of the members of your family (they structure using a family tree)
- Able to organize and new members of a family can easily learn about each family member -> structure organization
    - Facial recognition can possibly recognize people in photos and use that to then be able to group memories regarding a certain person
    - Can be able to create a “history” for each person


<img src="./images_p2/image (96).png" alt="alt text" width="800" height="200">
- Couples within a family can have both shared and joint memories (important to recognize many memories regarding couples would be shared)
- Clicking into certain photos allow you to dive “deeper” and see more content regarding that memory (mostly photo compilation with descriptions)
    - Having a basis as a family tree → click into family tree to dig deeper
    - We need to develop our own basis “archiving” system that people can then dig deeper into

### Storied

<img src="./images_p2/image (97).png" alt="alt text" width="450" height="200">

- Social media style of archiving where people can post (publicly or privately) content abou their family history, then detailing categories and people that the story is in reference to (also has family tree edition)
    - Addition to our app: Notification system when people add more to the memories so that others in the family know (especially when memories are being unarchived and archived)
    - AI could do the categorization and people within the memory based on analyzing the texts and photos of the memory discussed

### Facebook

<img src="./images_p2/image (98).png" alt="alt text" width="350" height="200">

- This is a screenshot of the Facebook memories page. The memories page allows users to recap “memories” from past dates (i.e. days, month, years) bundled into messages or short videos for the user. We can use a similar structure to Facebook memories to bundle archived memories into a collage/story for users so families can go back and view memories in a story-like way

### StoryWorth

<img src="./images_p2/image (99).png" alt="alt text" width="700" height="200">

- StoryWorth is an app that allows you to invite relatives to tell you stories about their life and the app will send them a new question to answer each week. In the clipping it shows stories are linked to the profile of the relative whose story it is and how you can navigate to the profile to see that prompt the story belongs to and are able to click the prompt to view the story. This is useful to the design brainstorming as we could organize posts/memories to user profiles who they belong to with the prompt they answered + the story as shown in the clipping above.

### iPhone Albums

<img src="./images_p2/image (100).png" alt="alt text" width="150" height="250">

- iPhone Albums is within the iPhone photos app and allows users to create collections of photos that they can share with others (i.e. family relatives, friends, etc.), collaborate with others on, and hide (if they want the album to be private). The creation of albums is similar to how we want to create archives of a collection of memories that consist of text and photos. We can use the layout and functionality of iPhone albums as a basis for our approach on how we want to build out the memory archives in our app, possibly taking on similar features to iPhone albums such as archive sharing, archive collaboration, and private archives.

### SumOne
<img src="./images_p2/image - 2024-11-13T214026.578.png" alt="alt text" width="200" height="250">

- SumOne is a relationship-focused app that provides prompts every day for couples to answer together, where the questions range from daily, simple questions to deeper conversations. Couples can view their past answers to reflect on their relationship. Couples can get pebbles by daily sign-in, answering questions, or watching ads. Pebbles can be spent on the decoration of the house of EggMon, the couple’s virtual pet. The increase in decorations symbols the growth of the relationship. We could use a similar prompting or gaming system within our app(?)

### Line
<img src="./images_p2/image (60).png" alt="alt text" width="200" height="250">

- Line is a multi-functional chat-based application incorporating chat, financial, news, videos features. In the chat functionality, users can either directly message another user, form a group chat, create an open chat, or message the official account of companies or retailers. Specifically, in direct message and group chat, the user can create albums to organize the photos which you want to share. Users often name the albums with the date and a brief title. Since the albums are sorted chronologically, this somehow serves a memory timeline for users to look back to their memory.

### KlokBox
<img src="./images_p2/image (61).png" alt="alt text" width="600" height="250">

- Klokbox is an application with a special feature “story boxes which is basically a digital time capsule. Users can create story boxes containing text, photos, videos, or documents that can be unlocked later by families and friends who you authorized. It also encourages users to record daily positive moments to boost happiness.

### [The Fabric of America](https://fabricofthenation.nepyru.com/)
<img src="./images_p2/image (62).png" alt="alt text" width="600" height="250">

- The archives of audio files are not presented to the user as a list, but rather it is presented as nodes on top of the american flag. 
- This highly visual representation of an archive in a non-traditional format emphasizes the  message and name of the web app, “Fabric of America”.
- The audio replay interface is also beautifully designed where the metaphor of “fabric” continues in the form of string-like, thread-like vibrations.

### [Rose Island](https://www.rose-island.co )
<img src="./images_p2/image (63).png" alt="alt text" width="600" height="250">

- Images are presented as interactable stacks. This user interaction makes the viewing experience more grounded to a physical photo album.

### [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/210568029/FROM-ARCHIVE-TO-SOCIAL-BRION-TOMB?tracking_source=search_projects|archive&l=13 )
<img src="./images_p2/image (64).png" alt="alt text" width="250" height="500">

- Super interesting visual way of archiving. 
- Collections of images are organized in “stacks”, making it visually stark to compare the volume of information between different stacks.

### Google Photos
<img src="./images_p2/image (65).png" alt="alt text" width="250" height="250">

- The vertical timeline bar allows for quick navigation to a particular place in time

<img src="./images_p2/image (66).png" alt="alt text" width="250" height="200">

- Google Photos shared album also has a sidebar that shows a chat like interface where user contribution is presented in chronological order. People can also chat but that seems to be not a popular feature as people mostly just care about the album interface on the left.

## Outlining your App: Concepts
### Goal Surveyer
- **Name**: Surveying
- **Purpose**: Surveys users on their intended goals for using the app to align the app’s content with those goals.
- **Operational Principle**: User \( U \) is given question \( Q \) with choices \( A, B, C, \dots \) and selects one option.

---

### Discussion Thread
- **Name**: Threading
- **Purpose**: Creates a dedicated space for discussing a single topic, allowing for a focused and organized conversation.
- **Operational Principle**: A user can create a thread \( T \) starting with media \( V \); other users can add media \( V' \) to the same \( T \) in chronological order.
  - **Example**: \( T \rightarrow V, V'1, V'2, \dots \)

---

### Memory Archive Notifications
- **Name**: Archive-Notifying
- **Purpose**: Notifies users of changes to significant memories, such as new content, archiving, or unarchiving.
- **Operational Principle**: After change \( X \) occurs in setting \( S \), user \( U \) within \( S \) is notified of change \( X \).

---

### Voice-to-Text Generator
- **Name**: Voicing
- **Purpose**: Captures audio and converts it into text for accessibility and easier sharing.
- **Operational Principle**: After recording media \( V \), the content of \( V \) is converted into text media \( T \).

---

### Deeper Question AI Generator
- **Name**: Deepening
- **Purpose**: An AI agent generates follow-up questions based on conversation flow to deepen engagement.
- **Operational Principle**: After \( T \) amount of time has lapsed, the AI agent takes in all messages \( M \) and contextually generates a new question \( Q \).

---

### Timeline Mode
- **Name**: Timetracing
- **Purpose**: Organizes all media in a linear timeline based on memory timestamps, rather than upload times.
- **Operational Principle**: Each piece of media \( V \) is tagged with a memory timestamp and added to the timeline in chronological order.

---

### Tree Visualization
- **Name**: Tree-ing
- **Purpose**: Builds a tree structure that grows as family members share memories, symbolizing family growth and connection.
- **Operational Principle**: Each time a user \( U \) shares a piece of media \( V \), an item \( F \) is added to the tree structure \( T \).

---

### Future Gatherings Planner/Scheduler
- **Name**: Scheduling
- **Purpose**: Allows a group of users to propose and agree on a time for a family event or gathering.
- **Operational Principle**: Each user \( u \) provides available time \( t_u \) for event \( e \); one user selects a final time \( t^* \) for \( e \) from the options \( t_u \). \( t^* \) is then added to a timeline, associated with content \( i \) for event \( e \).

## Outlining your App: Features
### Collaborative Remembering
- **Enabled by Concepts**: Threading, Surveying
- **Feature Description**: This feature allows users to create intentional memory threads aligned with each family member’s unique interests and curiosities. Through personalized prompts, each thread invites family members to contribute their memories, stories, and perspectives, engaging everyone in a co-remembering process that brings shared experiences to life.

---

### Evolving Memory Archive
- **Enabled by Concepts**: Tree-ing, Timetracing, Archive-Notifying
- **Feature Description**: The app’s dynamic archive organizes memories chronologically and notifies users of updates when significant changes are made, such as new contributions or memory updates. Each memory entry grows in a tree visualization, showing how memories and stories accumulate over time, creating an evolving archive of shared experiences.

---

### Guided Memory Sharing
- **Enabled by Concept**: Deepening
- **Feature Description**: An AI-driven agent generates contextually relevant follow-up questions within each memory thread, encouraging family members to delve deeper into shared stories. As users interact, the AI seamlessly introduces prompts that add depth, richness, and insight, transforming basic memories into detailed narratives.

---

### Effortless Contribution
- **Enabled by Concepts**: Threading, Voicing
- **Feature Description**: A familiar, chat-like interface and voice recording capabilities make it easy for users of all generations to add memories with minimal effort. Whether typing or speaking, family members can share stories and photos in a format that feels intuitive and accessible to everyone.

---

### Family Gatherings
- **Enabled by Concept**: Scheduling
- **Feature Description**: Family meetups can be difficult to coordinate through traditional group chats, especially with differing schedules or distant relatives. Our app simplifies scheduling in-person gatherings by asking family group members for their availability and collecting these times so a family member can view all options in an organized manner and select the best time for everyone.
