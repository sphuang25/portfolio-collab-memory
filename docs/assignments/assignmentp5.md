# Project Phase 6: User Testing & Final Release

## User Testing: Report and Reflect

### Users Tested:

#### Phoebe Zhang

I begun explaining the general idea of the app first to Phoebe before beginning, but was brief in terms of the exact user interface so I would be able to see if she could understand it. Creating a Profile, accepting an invitation to a family, and creating a thread to a discussion was really easy for her to figure out. She made a comment that she did not like that the invitations are in the "Families List" section. She said she would've rather preferred something like a contact book or simply a separate section in regards to a user's "friends" (or family members). She did notice that the voice memo and the photos did not seem to have actual function, and only created an empty thread within the discussion. The flow of the task of creating a post in a thread broke down during the Gulf of Evaluation as Phoebe expected some sort of pop up related to the image and audio icons she clicked, but instead got an empty thread post in the discussion. This makes sense because as a user, you would expect feedback related to what you click on the app, but in this case, she was met with an unexpected response that could cause confusion. She had difficulty trying to figure out the "archiving" aspect to add to the family timeline. This task's flow broke down in the gulf of execution. I infered that this was because the app doesn't use the word "archiving" in the button labelling, so it would be hard to make the connection that the button that says "Make new memory" is supposed to be used to make an archive. I gave her a hint to where the button was, and then she filled it out, but as she was filling out a title for the archive, I wasn't sure if she completely understood what the archiving function. So, I asked her if she knew what the difference between the discussion threads and archiving was, which led to a bit more elaboration than I initially wanted while testing. I think there was confusion between archiving and threading because these concepts are used in a relatively novel way in our app and there are no cues or instructions that are given in our app that explains what these concepts are to users and how they function in our app. I asked her what could possibly be helpful to demonstrate the distinction and she said "instructions," or simply anything to try explaining the general concept of the app. From her facial reactions while nevigating through the app, I was able to sense that the concept of the app could be difficult for users to intiially understand, but she still thought it was really nice. She stated there is a "learning curve" to it, but then her boyfriend came at the end of the interview, wondering what the app was, and she was able to explain it very clearly to him.

Phoebe had certain thoughts in regards to the user experience on the app. For example, though it is an archiving app, she thought it was a bit tedious in terms of having to manually put everything into an archive, and that she would "need the energy [to do] lots of clicking." A cool comparison that Phoebe made was to screenshotting conversations with friends and adding them to Photo Albums. She additionally made another comparison of the interface of the threads, which are block-shaped, to Canvas Discussion posts. While it made her feel like she should be writing a lot more to fill up the space, it made her feel deterred to write the natural "short word texts" she is used to writing. She also thought that making the text format more similar to an interface that users are more familiar with would be helpful. She subsequently described how in WeChat, they have a function similar to archiving where you can save messages into your "Favorites" and rearrange such texts. She also did not understand the color choice for the posts and asked me if there was a certain reason that some of the posts were certain colors and if she could change the colors. The final critique that Phoebe happened when I allowed Phoebe to go through any part of the app she wanted to, where she tried to make a new thread, but had difficulty finding where to do so. This task broke down in the gulf of execution. I suspected that this was because there is a very obvious thread tab in the navigation bar that incorrectly cues the user to think that this is where they should go to create a new thread. However, the page is just for viewing threads and to actually create a thread you need to go into the family page and create a thread within that page. She did not like how she had to go into the "Family" tab, and then to the "Threads" to make a new thread, and pointed out how her instinct told her she could just go straight to the threads tab.

To summarize a majority of the thoughts that Phoebe had, she wanted better organization and formatting for certain aspects of the app. She did think the idea of the app was really cool, and did acknowledge once she got used to it, she was able to use it with ease. But, again, when I could tell she seemed to be struggling more, I gave her slight hints in terms of the buttons.

#### Mia Rodriguez

Mia had an easy time with creating a Profile and joining a family invitation sent to her account. However, what took her a while, was making a memory. When I noticed her difficulty in performing this task, I began to suspect that it was the labelling of the button to create an archive again and how it uses the word "memory" instead of "archive". She clicked through almost every part of the app before seeing the "Make a Memory" button next to the folder tabs of the webpage. She said that the wording of "Make a Memory" made her not think it had to do specifically with "archiving," which was the instructions that I gave to her. She also asked me a question (which I instead had her try out instead of answering), but was that is threads were only allowed to be in certain memories (one message is only able to be in one memory) or a thread can be in multiple memories at the time, in which she found out that it was the latter.

Mia had a suprisingly fun time as "grandma Jane" creating posts and trying to figure out how to create more memories. However, as she continued to play on the site, she had tiny comments. For example, there were no gaps between the commas when listing the members in the family (which she said triggered her OCD), why threads and profile do not have the "tab" background but other sections of the app did, and the padding at the header of the titles of the webpages not being equal for all of the sections. It was interesting to me that Mia noticed these details of the app and how they affected her user experience. Mia had a similar comment as Phoebe about not being able to add threads to the home section, which she was able to find as she was clicking around the site rather than struggling to find the option. This confusion likely occurred because the functionality to create a new thread is within the family page and is not within the obvious "read-only" Threading tab that is on the navigation bar. The interaction that took place of Mia going through the site and eventually figuring out how to create a thread made me infer that hidden features in the app would be learnable by users, but during that learning curve some frustration and confusion would occur due to the gulf of execution (such as the one that occurs when trying to create a thread). As she was trying to demonstrate to me that the four different options in the "Families" section (Members, Invites, Threads, Leave Family), she accidentally clicked Leave Family and left one of the pre-made families we made for her. She laughed and said how maybe instead it would be nicer to have the "Leave Family" section be on the right side of each of the families in the "Home" section as a little red trash can, and also have a confirm button. The final major remark that Mia had was in regard to the Profile. She asked what the point of the Profile was if all it did was state the goals, and I explained to her the initial intention with utilizing AI alongside the app. She thought the idea was really cool. She said that maybe if the Profile section was at the top right next to the "Hello, grandma Jane," it would make more sense. She kept clicking at the "Hello, grandma Jane," but there was no function to it. I inferred a gulf of evaluation when this occurred as she expected something to happen when she clicking the "Hello, (username)" text but nothing happened.

Overall, Mia was able to navigate through almost all of the app (except the initial archiving).

#### Selin Dursun

No problem logging in. Selin had no problem logging in with the provided account of “aunt cathay”.

Receiving and accepting an invitation to join a family was difficult. She doesn’t know when she has received an invitation and refreshed the web page a few times to check. I suspected a gulf of evaluation here as she probably was expecting feedback from the app after accepting the invitation, but didn't receive any cues of what accepting an invite achieved within the app. After she proceeded to navigate through all the pages to find where this invitation could be. She wishes there is a pop-up notification for the invitee that indicates to the user that an invitation has landed and requires user action. This could expand the functionality of the sidebar.

When asked to create a new thread, Selin goes straight into the thread tab and doesn't see a plus button. Again, this was most likely when the flow broke down in the gulf of evaluation as she most likely heard "threads" when I asked her to perform the tasks and immediately saw the tab that said "threads", expecting that everything she needed to perform the task would be there, which is reasonable. This made her think this is an archive and the creation button is elsewhere. In the end, I had to show her that it is nested within the family. When creating a new thread, she associated making the thread as making a title for a chat and was confused as to why she needs to write a title, then make a post when she only has the intention of writing down the same thing. For her, making a thread is more about logging her idea/memory down quickly, and doesn’t like the delay of making a title. She referenced chatgpt creating a title for the chat automatically that can be changed later by the user.

No issue. But doesn’t like the boxiness of the post, thinks it is a clickable item
Creating a post was intuitive, but she thinks the purple boxes created are clickable. I suspect this could be because of the shadowing behind that post boxes that make it look like its a button.

When I was prompted to create an archive to add to the timeline, Selin focused on the word “timeline” and went straight into the timeline tab and saw no button to create an archive. But when i said “add a memory”, she remembered the plus button with the word “memory” and went back to the active thread. The task broke down in the gulf of execution as the labelling of the archive creation button doesn't have the word "archive" in it. She treated making a memory like it was another way to make a post and didn’t realize that the point is to archive a collection of posts and didn’t think that the posts are selectable/clickable despite the short helper sentence we put right next to the save button.

After creating a memory/ archive, she didn’t realize that “timeline” is where the archived memories show up. Again, no real-time notification on the sidebar to show where it is added, so there was likely a break down in the gulf of evaluation as she expected to get feedback on where the new archive is located but didn't. Word associations (i.e. using archive in labels that refer to archive related functionalities) were important.

## Flaws and Opportunities for Improvement

### 1. Invitation Section

- **Flaw**: Invitations are currently in the "Families List" section, which users found unintuitive in terms of location. Users expected a separate or dedicated section for managing connections like a contact book or a "Friends/Family Invitations" section.
- **Why It Occurs**: The design places invitations alongside other family management options (and of these options the invitations section is placed at the very bottom of the page and requires scrolling to view it), making it less prominent and harder to locate for users. This is additionally enhanced by the fact that if a user is in multiple families, they would have to scroll down further to be able to view their invitations.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Create a dedicated "Invitations" tab similar to a Contact Book where a User can see all of the connections they have through their families. Another option is creating an invitation tab and only displaying invitations that have not been accepted/rejected.
- **Level**: Physical
- **Severity**: Moderate

### 2. Difficulty in Understanding "Archiving"

- **Flaw**: Users seem to not understand the difference between threads and archived memories and how to differentiate the two concepts. 
- **Why It Occurs**: The current design does not adequately differentiate or explain the two concepts within the app's interface. There is no page, specific instructions, or obvious cues that can help the user understand what threading and archiving mean in our app. Our app leaves it to the user to explore and "discover" the meaning of these concepts which seemed to be a steep learning curve and resulted in us having to intervene in some of the interviews to explain the concept for users to understand and perform tasks using these concepts.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Add clear, accessible instructions in the beginning of the app to explain the difference between threads and archives, like a "How to use this app" page that displays when a user first registers. Change the labelling of the archiving button from "Make new memory" to "Make new archive". Add text on the thread and archive page below the title to explain what the page is for, so that users can learn about the function while exploring the various pages.
- **Level**: Conceptual
- **Severity**: Major

### 3. Tedious Navigation for Creating Threads

- **Flaw**: Users needed to navigate into the "Families" tab and then into "Threads" to create a new thread, making it tedious for users.
- **Why It Occurs**: The app's structure places thread creation within the families section which is not initially visible and requires clicking through various layers of screens to get to the thread creation page. The thread tab also seemed to be confusing (i.e. see Phoebe's interview) since there is a thread tab in the navigation bar that is "easier to access", but users could not create a thread on this page since this page is just for viewing.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Add a "New Thread" button directly in the "Threads" section to allow for users to create threads within the thread tab of the navigation bar. Include a message in the thread tab of the navigation bar that tells users that in order to create a thread they must go to the threads page within their family page.
- **Level**: Physical
- **Severity**: Moderate

### 4. Inconsistent Design Elements within the Userface

- **Flaw**: Slight inconsistencies regarding the padding, tab backgrounds, and spacing distraced from the aesthetic of the app
- **Why It Occurs**: Lack of standardized design CSS across different sections of the app.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Standardize the design and padding across all sections of the app within the CSS file by reusing CSS code. We can use similar sizing or layouts (i.e. the family list component page could have the same grid layout as the thread list component page) to make pages look more consistent.
- **Level**: Physical
- **Severity**: Minor

### 5. Lack of Purpose within the Profile Section

- **Flaw**: Users questioned the purpose of the profile section, as it currently only displays goals. Additionally, clicking the username at the top did not have any functions
- **Why It Occurs**: The profile section lacks features or integrations that would make it more purposeful. By clicking on the profile related components of the page (i.e. the "Welcome, (insert username)" text), there is no action that occurs and no feedback given to the user that changes pages or tells them that their action did something within the app (i.e. See Mia's interview for her comments on this).
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Profile section could include the integration of the intended AI usage. Additionally, the "Hello, \_\_\_\_" section could lead to the Profile instead to provide some feedback via page changing to the user.
- **Level**: Conceptual
- **Severity**: Moderate

### 6. Lack of Locational Visual Notification

- **Flaw**: When an event occurs, such as creating an archive or receiving an invite, there is no direct visual confirmation or feedback to the user that suggest "where" in the app this happened and where they should go to check it out.
- **Why It Occurs**: The database updates in the backend after a successful upload, but the frontend user doesn't know that. The app should give the user real-time feedback on all the changes that is happening the back and have an intuitve way to navigate and see the changes that was made.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Create a pop up notification icon next to the tab button that an event is occuring in, to prompt user to click (i.e. when a use makes an archive, have a pop up on the timeline tab to cue that the archive was added to the timeline). We could also include toast messages that responds to user actions such as creating threads/archives, posting, etc. to provide additional feedback to users to confirm their action did something in the app.
- **Level**: Physical
- **Severity**: Moderate

## Fix for Flaws in Finalize Implementation

### Invitation Section

An invitation tab is created to display all invites received. I did consider whether I should also allow user to send invitation in this tab, but I think this makes user confused even more. Hence, sending invites is still in Family tab, where viewing received invitation has a separate tab (the "Invitations" tab).

### Tedious Navigation for Creating Threads

My original idea is to force user to get inside family to create Threads, so one can avoid adding threads with similar topics when one sees the existing Threads. But since the user thought the process was tedious, now user can also create a new thread in the Thread tab by specifying the family that one wants to add a Thread to.

### Fixed "Lack of Purpose within the Profile Section" clicking of the Username

We were able to take Mia's concern into account and removed the Profile section from the tabs and included it instead to the top right corner of the webpage. This now allows for the Profile and anything related to the user itself to be in one section. This also addresses Mia's confusion when trying to click on the "Welcome, (insert username)" text at the top right of the page and not getting any feedback from the app.

### Fixed "Inconsistent Design Elements within the Userface"

We were able to standardize most of the app's UI (i.e. the family list page and the thread list page look almost identical). We also added scrollable text in the posts to prevent text overflow of posts. The memory archive menu was also changed to prevent the menu from covering posts and to make it more aesthetically pleasing on the thread content page. Based on Mia's suggestions, the padding and spacing on the family page and thread content pages were also changed to be more aesthetic and consistent with the rest of the app.

### Fixed "Lack of Locational Visual Notification"

We were able to address Selin's confusion after creating a memory archive and not knowing where it added or how to find it after. Now there is a red indicator that pops up next to the "Timeline" button on the sidebar nav after an archive has been creeated.

## Design Revision 

1. The scope of the Thread concept
> The original plan was for Thread to have its own page. When you create a thread, you can select certain users in the same family to have the access to this thread. However, this felt a little unclear and was hard for the user to build a mental model. For example, A and B are both in family F1 and F2. Now you create thread T1 based on members of F1: A,B,C, and you create another thread T2 based on members of F2: A,B,D, the overlap of user A,B will lead to user's confusion about which family is this thread based on.

> Hence, we changed the entire backend and frontend, so that a thread is constructed based on each family. And to simplify the operations for the user, all members can access the thread that is created in the family. 

> Users can now see threads that correspond the family under the family tab > threads. They can also see all threads from different families in the Thread tab. According to the user test, interviewees would also like to be able to create new threads not just under family, so now users can create new threads in the general Thread tab by selecting which family the users want to add the thread to.

2. Removal of Commenting Concept

> The structure of the application used to be Thread > Post > Comment. Where people can construct a Thread with a prompt, users can make Posts under the each Thread, and also Comment under Posts. We think making post performs the function of "replying" to the threads, the addition of "commenting" might confuse the users because there are too many layers. We also saw how confusion grew when more layers were used in other areas of the app (i.e. having to go to the family page, select a family, and then being able to make a thread/post in a thread -- see Phoebe's interview), so ultimately decided to leave out the Commenting concept.

3. Remove Family Request and add Invite Tab

> The previous idea for the family concept was similar to the Friending Concept that we used to have, where users can send a request to join a family, family can also send an invitation to the user. However, we think family is supposed to be a more closed, private place, and we don't want a user to type in random familyname or id to successfully send a request to a family, so we only retain the "invitation" feature. Part of our app's mission is making a safe space for family members to connect and we feel that privacy is a part of that. All members in the family can invite other users into the family, but request to join a family can no longer be made.

> According the user test, the user would like to have a seperate tab for received invitation, instead of listing under the families that one is currently in. Hence, a new tab was added.

4. Notification

> We did not specify what notification will look like in the early stage of this project, but the main idea is to engage user to check the memories that one archived. Currently, if you add a new archive, there will be a small dot beside the text of "Timeline" tab, which is the current implementation of notification.
> In P3, we planned for backend functionality to notify groups of people; however, we didn't feel like this funtionality would contribute much to the user experience of the app. From our user testing, users seemed more concerned with getting feedback from the app based on what actions they took and didn't really mention wanting to know what others are doing on the app.
> So, we decided to keep the function of the notifying concept narrow to highlight changes to one of the key features of our app: creating an archive and seeing it on the timeline.

5. Removal of Audio, Image Posts, and AI functionality

> Based on our feedback from P5, we removed the audio and image post buttons from the Threading Content Page as the backend functionality for these buttons is not complete so leaving these buttons the screen confused users since they don't do anything of value. We also revised the app to not include AI functionality as the backend for this is not implemented. We believe that with our profiling concept (which allows users to communicate their goals for using the app) and the text posting functionality in threading is sufficient to satisfy our app's goal of sharing memories and learning about family members through sharing meaningful conversations.
> From our user testing, we saw that people were interested and had fun using the app as is and how each user had their own "style" of communicating on the app, so we feel like not having AI prompting and audio/image functionality doesn't impact our app's mission. However, in the future we would like to explore adding AI, image, and audio functionality to help improve the accessibility of our app (i.e. older folks may have a hard time typing on the keyboard and prefer sending voice memos).
