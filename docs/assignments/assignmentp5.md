# Project Phase 6: User Testing & Final Release

## User Testing: Report and Reflect
### Users Tested:
#### Phoebe Zhang
I begun explaining the general idea of the app first to Phoebe before beginning, but was brief in terms of the exact user interface so I would be able to see if she could understand it. Creating a Profile, accepting an invitation to a family, and creating a thread to a discussion was really easy for her to figure out. She made a comment that she did not like that the invitations are in the "Families List" section. She said she would've rather preferred something like a contact book or simply a separate section in regards to a user's "friends" (or family members). She did notice that the voice memo and the photos did not seem to have actual function, and only created an empty thread within the discussion. She had difficulty trying to figure out the "archiving" aspect to add to the family timeline. I gave her a hint to where the button was, and then she filled it out, but as she was filling out a title for the archive, I wasn't sure if she completely understood what the archiving function was. So, I asked her if she knew what the difference between the discussion threads and archiving was, which led to a bit more elaboration than I initially wanted while testing. I asked her what could possibly be helpful to demonstrate the distinction and she said "instructions," or simply anything to try explaining the general concept of the app. From her facial reactions while nevigating through the app, I was able to sense hat the concept of the app could be difficult for users to intiially understand, but she still thought it was really nice. She stated there is a "learning curve" to it, but then her boyfriend came at the end of the interview, wondering what the app was, and she was able to explain it very clearly to him. 

Phoebe had certain thoughts in regards to the user experience on the app. For example, though it is an archiving app, she thought it was a bit tedious in terms of having to manually put everything into an archive, and that she would "need the energy [to do] lots of clicking." A cool comparison that Phoebe made was to screenshotting conversations with friends and adding them to Photo Albums. She additionally made another comparison of the interface of the threads, which are block-shaped, to Canvas Discussion posts. While it made her feel like she should be writing a lot more to fill up the space, it made her feel deterred to write the natural "short word texts" she is used to writing. She also though that making the text format more similar to an interface that users are more familiar with would be helpful. She subsequently described how in WeChat, they have a function similar to archiving where you can save messages into your "Favorites" and rearrange such texts. She also did not understand the color choice for the posts and asked me if there was a certain reason that some of the posts were certain colors and if she could change the colors. The final critique that Phoebe happened when I allowed Phoebe to go through any part of the app she wanted to, where she tried to make a new thread, but had difficulty finding where to do so. She did not like how she had to go into the "Family" tab, and then to the "Threads" to make a new thread, and pointed out how her instinct told her she could just go straight to the threads tab. 

To summarize a majority of the thoughts that Phoebe had, she wanted better organization and formatting for certain aspects of the app. She did think the idea of the app was really cool, and did acknowedlege once she got used to it, she was able to use it with ease. But, again, when I could tell she seemed to be struggling more, I gave her slight hints in terms of the buttons.

#### Mia Rodriguez
Mia had an easy time with creating a Profile and joining a family invitation sent to her account. However, what took her a while, was making a memory. She clicked through almost every part of the app before seeing the "Make a Memory" button next to the folder tabs of the webpage. She said that the wording of "Make a Memory" made her not think it had to do specifically with "archiving," which was the instructions that I gave to her. She also asked me a question (which I instead had her try out instead of answering), but was that is threads were only allowed to be in certain memories (one message is only able to be in one memory) or a thread can be in multiple memories at the time, in which she found out that it was the latter. 

Mia had a suprisingly fun time as "grandma Jane" creating posts and trying to figure out how to create more memories. However, as she continued to play on the site, she had tiny comments. For example, there were no gaps between the commas when listing the members in the family (which she said triggered her OCD), why threads and profile do not have the "tab" background but other sections of the app did, and the padding at the header of the titles of the webpages not being equal for all of the sections. Mia had a similar to comment as Phoebe about not being able to add threads to the home section, which she was able to find as she was clicking around the site rather than struggling to find the option. However, as she was trying to demonstrate to me that the four different options in the "Families" section (Members, Invites, Threads, Leave Family), she accidentally clicked Leave Family and left one of the pre-made families we made for her. She laughed and said how maybe instead it would be nicer to have the "Leave Family" section be on the right side of each of the families in the "Home" section as a little red trash can, and also have a confirm button. The final major remark that Mia had was in regard to the Profile. She asked what the point of the Profile was if all it did was state the goals, and I explained to her the initial intention with utilizing AI alongside the app. She thought the idea was really cool. She said that maybe if the Profile section was at the top right next to the "Hello, grandma Jane," it would make more sense. She kept clicking at the "Hello, grandma Jane," but there was no function to it.

Overall, Mia was able to navigate through almost all of the app (except the initial archiving). 

### Flaws and Opportunities for Improvement
#### 1. Invitation Section
- **Flaw**: Invitations are currently in the "Families List" section, which users found unintuitive in terms of location. Users expected a separate or dedicated section for managing connections like a contact book or a "Friends/Family Invitations" section.
- **Why It Occurs**: The design places invitations alongside other family management options, making it less prominent and harder to locate for users. This is additionally enhanced by the fact that if a user is in multiple families, they would have to scroll down further to be able to view their invitations.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Create a dedicated "Invitations" tab similar to a Contact Book where a User can see all of the connections they have through their families
- **Level**: Physical  
- **Severity**: Moderate  

#### 2. Difficulty in Understanding "Archiving"
- **Flaw**: Users seem to not understand the distinction between threads and archived memories and how to differentiate the two sections.
- **Why It Occurs**: The current design does not adequately differentiate or explain the two concepts within the app's interface.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Add clear, accessible instructions in the beginning of the app (or perhaps rework some integral part of the app -- still undecided) to explain the difference between threads and archives. 
- **Level**: Conceptual  
- **Severity**: Major  

#### 3. Tedious Navigation for Creating Threads
- **Flaw**: Users needed to navigate into the "Families" tab and then into "Threads" to create a new thread, making it tedious for users.
- **Why It Occurs**: The app's structure places thread creation within the families section when it could be in the "easier to access" Threads section
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Add a "New Thread" button directly in the "Threads" section.
- **Level**: Physical  
- **Severity**: Moderate  

#### 4. Inconsistent Design Elements within the Userface
- **Flaw**: Slight inconsistencies regarding the padding, tab backgrounds, and spacing distraced from the aesthetic of the app
- **Why It Occurs**: Lack of standardized design CSS across different sections of the app.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Standardize the design and padding across all sections of the app within the CSS file.
- **Level**: Physical  
- **Severity**: Minor  

#### 5. Lack of Purpose within the Profile Section
- **Flaw**: Users questioned the purpose of the profile section, as it currently only displays goals. Additionally, clicking the username at the top did not have any functions
- **Why It Occurs**: The profile section lacks features or integrations that would make it more purposeful.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Profile section could include inalized the integration of the intended AI usage. Additionally, the "Hello, ____" section could lead to the Profile Instead
- **Level**: Conceptual  
- **Severity**: Moderate  

### Finalize Implementation
#### Fixed "Lack of Purpose within the Profile Section" clicking of the Username
We were able to take Mia's concern into account and removed the Profile section from the tabs and included it instead to the top right corner of the webpage. This now allows for the Profile and anything related to the user itself to be in one section.
