# Project Phase 6: User Testing & Final Release

## User Testing: Report and Reflect

### Users Tested:

#### Phoebe Zhang

I begun explaining the general idea of the app first to Phoebe before beginning, but was brief in terms of the exact user interface so I would be able to see if she could understand it. Creating a Profile, accepting an invitation to a family, and creating a thread to a discussion was really easy for her to figure out. She made a comment that she did not like that the invitations are in the "Families List" section. She said she would've rather preferred something like a contact book or simply a separate section in regards to a user's "friends" (or family members). She did notice that the voice memo and the photos did not seem to have actual function, and only created an empty thread within the discussion. She had difficulty trying to figure out the "archiving" aspect to add to the family timeline. I gave her a hint to where the button was, and then she filled it out, but as she was filling out a title for the archive, I wasn't sure if she completely understood what the archiving function was. So, I asked her if she knew what the difference between the discussion threads and archiving was, which led to a bit more elaboration than I initially wanted while testing. I asked her what could possibly be helpful to demonstrate the distinction and she said "instructions," or simply anything to try explaining the general concept of the app. From her facial reactions while nevigating through the app, I was able to sense hat the concept of the app could be difficult for users to intiially understand, but she still thought it was really nice. She stated there is a "learning curve" to it, but then her boyfriend came at the end of the interview, wondering what the app was, and she was able to explain it very clearly to him.

Phoebe had certain thoughts in regards to the user experience on the app. For example, though it is an archiving app, she thought it was a bit tedious in terms of having to manually put everything into an archive, and that she would "need the energy [to do] lots of clicking." A cool comparison that Phoebe made was to screenshotting conversations with friends and adding them to Photo Albums. She additionally made another comparison of the interface of the threads, which are block-shaped, to Canvas Discussion posts. While it made her feel like she should be writing a lot more to fill up the space, it made her feel deterred to write the natural "short word texts" she is used to writing. She also though that making the text format more similar to an interface that users are more familiar with would be helpful. She subsequently described how in WeChat, they have a function similar to archiving where you can save messages into your "Favorites" and rearrange such texts. She also did not understand the color choice for the posts and asked me if there was a certain reason that some of the posts were certain colors and if she could change the colors. The final critique that Phoebe happened when I allowed Phoebe to go through any part of the app she wanted to, where she tried to make a new thread, but had difficulty finding where to do so. She did not like how she had to go into the "Family" tab, and then to the "Threads" to make a new thread, and pointed out how her instinct told her she could just go straight to the threads tab.

To summarize a majority of the thoughts that Phoebe had, she wanted better organization and formatting for certain aspects of the app. She did think the idea of the app was really cool, and did acknowedlege once she got used to it, she was able to use it with ease. But, again, when I could tell she seemed to be struggling more, I gave her slight hints in terms of the buttons.

#### Mia Rodriguez

Mia had an easy time with creating a Profile and joining a family invitation sent to her account. However, what took her a while, was making a memory. She clicked through almost every part of the app before seeing the "Make a Memory" button next to the folder tabs of the webpage. She said that the wording of "Make a Memory" made her not think it had to do specifically with "archiving," which was the instructions that I gave to her. She also asked me a question (which I instead had her try out instead of answering), but was that is threads were only allowed to be in certain memories (one message is only able to be in one memory) or a thread can be in multiple memories at the time, in which she found out that it was the latter.

Mia had a suprisingly fun time as "grandma Jane" creating posts and trying to figure out how to create more memories. However, as she continued to play on the site, she had tiny comments. For example, there were no gaps between the commas when listing the members in the family (which she said triggered her OCD), why threads and profile do not have the "tab" background but other sections of the app did, and the padding at the header of the titles of the webpages not being equal for all of the sections. Mia had a similar to comment as Phoebe about not being able to add threads to the home section, which she was able to find as she was clicking around the site rather than struggling to find the option. However, as she was trying to demonstrate to me that the four different options in the "Families" section (Members, Invites, Threads, Leave Family), she accidentally clicked Leave Family and left one of the pre-made families we made for her. She laughed and said how maybe instead it would be nicer to have the "Leave Family" section be on the right side of each of the families in the "Home" section as a little red trash can, and also have a confirm button. The final major remark that Mia had was in regard to the Profile. She asked what the point of the Profile was if all it did was state the goals, and I explained to her the initial intention with utilizing AI alongside the app. She thought the idea was really cool. She said that maybe if the Profile section was at the top right next to the "Hello, grandma Jane," it would make more sense. She kept clicking at the "Hello, grandma Jane," but there was no function to it.

Overall, Mia was able to navigate through almost all of the app (except the initial archiving).

#### Selin Dursun

No problem logging in. Selin had no problem logging in with the provided account of “aunt cathay”.

Receiving and accepting an invitation to join a family was difficult. She doesn’t know when she has received an invitation and refreshed the web page a few times to check. After she proceeded to navigate through all the pages to find where this invitation could be. She wishes there is a pop-up notification for the invitee that indicates to the user that an invitation has landed and requires user action. This could expand the functionality of the sidebar.

When asked to create a new thread, Selin goes straight into the thread tab and doesn't see a plus button. This made her think this is an archive and the creation button is elsewhere. In the end, I had to show her that it is nested within the family. When creating a new thread, she associated making the thread as making a title for a chat and was confused as to why she needs to write a title, then make a post when she only has the intention of writing down the same thing. For her, making a thread is more about logging her idea/memory down quickly, and doesn’t like the delay of making a title. She referenced chatgpt creating a title for the chat automatically that can be changed later by the user.

No issue. But doesn’t like the boxiness of the post, thinks it is a clickable item
Creating a post was intuitive, but she thinks the purple boxes created are clickable.

When I was prompted to create an archive to add to the timeline, Selin focused on the word “timeline” and went straight into the timeline tab and saw no button to create an archive. But when i said “add a memory”, she remembered the plus button with the word “memory” and went back to the active thread. She treated making a memory like it was another way to make a post and didn’t realize that the point is to archive a collection of posts and didn’t think that the posts are selectable/clickable despite the short helper sentence we put right next to the save button.

After creating a memory/ archive, she didn’t realize that “timeline” is where the archived memories show up. Again, no real-time notification on the sidebar to show where it is added. Word associations are important.

## Flaws and Opportunities for Improvement

### 1. Invitation Section

- **Flaw**: Invitations are currently in the "Families List" section, which users found unintuitive in terms of location. Users expected a separate or dedicated section for managing connections like a contact book or a "Friends/Family Invitations" section.
- **Why It Occurs**: The design places invitations alongside other family management options, making it less prominent and harder to locate for users. This is additionally enhanced by the fact that if a user is in multiple families, they would have to scroll down further to be able to view their invitations.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Create a dedicated "Invitations" tab similar to a Contact Book where a User can see all of the connections they have through their families
- **Level**: Physical
- **Severity**: Moderate

### 2. Difficulty in Understanding "Archiving"

- **Flaw**: Users seem to not understand the distinction between threads and archived memories and how to differentiate the two sections.
- **Why It Occurs**: The current design does not adequately differentiate or explain the two concepts within the app's interface.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Add clear, accessible instructions in the beginning of the app (or perhaps rework some integral part of the app -- still undecided) to explain the difference between threads and archives.
- **Level**: Conceptual
- **Severity**: Major

### 3. Tedious Navigation for Creating Threads

- **Flaw**: Users needed to navigate into the "Families" tab and then into "Threads" to create a new thread, making it tedious for users.
- **Why It Occurs**: The app's structure places thread creation within the families section when it could be in the "easier to access" Threads section
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Add a "New Thread" button directly in the "Threads" section.
- **Level**: Physical
- **Severity**: Moderate

### 4. Inconsistent Design Elements within the Userface

- **Flaw**: Slight inconsistencies regarding the padding, tab backgrounds, and spacing distraced from the aesthetic of the app
- **Why It Occurs**: Lack of standardized design CSS across different sections of the app.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Standardize the design and padding across all sections of the app within the CSS file.
- **Level**: Physical
- **Severity**: Minor

### 5. Lack of Purpose within the Profile Section

- **Flaw**: Users questioned the purpose of the profile section, as it currently only displays goals. Additionally, clicking the username at the top did not have any functions
- **Why It Occurs**: The profile section lacks features or integrations that would make it more purposeful.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Profile section could include inalized the integration of the intended AI usage. Additionally, the "Hello, \_\_\_\_" section could lead to the Profile Instead
- **Level**: Conceptual
- **Severity**: Moderate

### 6. Lack of Locational Visual Notification

- **Flaw**: When an event occurs, such as creating an archive or recieving an invite, there is no direct visual confirmation or feedback to the user that suggest "where" in the app this happened and where they should go to check it out.
- **Why It Occurs**: The database updates in the backend after a successful upload, but the frontend user doesn't know that. The app should give the user real-time feedback on all the changes that is happening the back and have an intuitve way to navigate and see the changes that was made.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Create a pop up notifcation icon next to the tab button it is occuring in, to prompt user to click.
- **Level**: Physical
- **Severity**: Moderate

## Fix for Flaws in Finalize Implementation

### Invitation Section

An invitation tab is created to display all invites received. I did consider whether I should also allow user to send invitation in this tab, but I think this makes user confused even more. Hence, sending invites is still in Family tab, where received invitation has a separate tab.

### Tedious Navigation for Creating Threads

My original idea is to force user to get inside family to create Threads, so one can avoid adding threads with similar topics when one sees the existing Threads. But since the user thought the process was tedious, now user can also create a new thread in the Thread tab by specifying the family that one wants to add a Thread to.

### Fixed "Lack of Purpose within the Profile Section" clicking of the Username

We were able to take Mia's concern into account and removed the Profile section from the tabs and included it instead to the top right corner of the webpage. This now allows for the Profile and anything related to the user itself to be in one section.

### Fixed "Lack of Locational Visual Notification"

We were able to address Selin's confusion after creating a memory archive and not knowing where it added or how to find it after. Now there is a red indicator that pops up next to the "Timeline" button on the sidebar nav after an archive has been creeated.

## Design Revision

1. The scope of the Thread concept
> The original plan was Thread has its own page. When you create a thread, you can select certain users in the same family to have the access to this thread. However, this felt a little unclear and was hard for the user to build mental model. For example, A and B are both in family F1 and F2. Now you create thread T1 based on members of F1: A,B,C, and you create another thread T2 based on members of F2: A,B,D, the overlap of user A,B will lead to user's confusion about which family is this thread based on.

> Hence, we changed the entire backend and frontend, so that a thread is constructed based on each family. And to simplify the operations for the user, all members can access the thread that is created in the family. 

> Users can now see threads that correspond the family under the family tab > threads. They can also see all threads from different families in the Thread tab. According to the user test, interviewees would also like to be able to create new threads not just under family, so now users can create new threads in the general Thread tab by selecting which family do the users want to add the thread to.

2. Removal of Commenting Concept

> The structure of the application were used to be Thread > Post > Comment. Where people can construct a Thread with a prompt, users can make Posts under the each Thread, and also Comment under Posts. We think making post performs the function of "replying" to the threads, the addition of "commenting" might confused the users because there are too many layers.

3. Family Request/ Invite

> The previous idea for the family concept was similar to the Friending Concept that we used to have, where users can send an request to join a family, family can also send an invitation to the user. However, we think family is supposed to be a more closed, private place, and we don't want user to type in random familyname or id to successfully send a request to a family, so we only retain the "invitation" feature. All members in the family can invite other users into the family, but request to join a family can no longer be made.

> According the user test, the user would like to have a seperate tab for received invitation, instead of listing under the families that one is currently in. Hence, a new tab was added.

4. Notification

> We did not specify what notification will look like in the early stage of this project, but the main idea is to engage user to check the memories that one archived. Currently, if you add a new archive, there will be a small dot beside the text of "Timeline" tab, which is the current implementation of notification.
